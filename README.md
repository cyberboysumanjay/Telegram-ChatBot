# Setup
I'm assuming you have Python 3 installed and running on your PC.

1- Get you Bot Access token by creating a new bot on [BotFather](http://t.me/BotFather).
2- Add the bot token in chat_bot.py (Search for the commented line)
3- Install the required libraries using these commands:
#### On Linux
>> sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
#### On Windows
>> pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Fire up the script

Now have a cup of coffee and wait for the training of the bot to finish.
When training is finished, start the bot

##### Happy Chatting!
